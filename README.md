The Online Code Editor is a user-friendly web-based tool project designed for developing simple web projects using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. With its intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) and compatibility with basic computer specifications, this editor offers an accessible platform for web developers. The editor's lightweight and efficient design ensures smooth performance on low-end machines. It supports the three core technologies of web development, allowing users to write and execute code seamlessly. Additional features such as the Reset Option, open and save functionality, CodeMirror integration for syntax highlighting, auto tag closure and editor theme, Two layout options for an optimal viewing experience and Direct access to Learning Resources enhance the development process

## Limitations

**Please Note**: The current implementation of the Online Code Editor project has a limitation in terms of its supported languages. It is specifically designed to work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only. While these languages cover a wide range of web development needs, it does mean that other programming languages are not supported within the editor also, the project currently supports only single-page development.

Additionally, the editor has a specific constraint related to JavaScript (JS) functionality. It supports JavaScript code execution only when written inside functions. This means that JavaScript code should be enclosed within function blocks for it to be executed and produce the desired results within the editor. Any standalone JavaScript code outside of functions may not be executed or behave as expected.

Considering this constraint, it is recommended to adhere to writing JavaScript code within function blocks while utilizing the editor's capabilities for JavaScript development. This ensures that the JavaScript functionality is properly interpreted and executed within the editor environment. It is important to keep these limitations in mind when working with the editor.
